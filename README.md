# Problem Statement

Solar Tracking System for Automated Irrigation 

# Abstract

As the non-renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day. Solar 
panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.

The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a 
maximum extent. This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun. 
The stored energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is use for irrigation for the forms, 
automatic light and in the fields where the application can be applied. 

Energy cost and decreasing supplies of fossil fuels, emphasis on protecting the environment and creating sustainable forms of power have become vital, high priority projects for modern society. Since, as solar energy which is also considered a renewable form of energy can be used to offset some of the power coming from the main grid that is generated by let us say nonrenewable sources of energy.

# Objectives

	Efficient Use of Solar Energy by Solar Tracking System.

	Power system and backup from solar.

	Sensor based irrigation which is directed by controller.

	Automated lights work during darkness.

	To minimize water waste from automated irrigation systems, we have improved irrigation controllers, which senses the soil.

	The overall system uses the energy from the stored solar power energy and acts power backup.

# Components Used

# Microcontroller ATmega328
ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform, namely the Arduino Uno and Arduino Nano models.

# Solar Panel
Energy systems with solar panels are being used in more homes today than ever before. A solar panel system function starts with the photovoltaic cell which gets light from the sun and turns it into electricity. In order for that to happen the function of a semiconductor must take place.

# Comparator
In electronics, a comparator is a device that compares two voltages or currents and outputs a digital signal indicating which is larger. 

# Relay
A relay is an electronic control device, which has a control system (also called an input loop) and a controlled system (also called an output loop), and is usually used in automatic control circuits.

# LDR
A Light Dependent Resistor (also known as a photoresistor or LDR) is a device whose resistivity is a function of the incident electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they are light-sensitive devices. They are also called as photoconductors, photoconductive cells or simply photocells.
