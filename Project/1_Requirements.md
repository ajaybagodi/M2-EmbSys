# Introduction

As the non-renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. 
Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day. Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.

The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent. 
This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun.

The stored energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. 
Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is use for irrigation for the forms, automatic light and in the fields where the application can be applied.

# Requirements

# High Level Requirements

|ID|Description|Catogary|
|-----|--------|---------|
|HL01 |The rotation of panel takes place depending on the intensity of LDR,it rotates(clockwise&anti-clockwise) towards on which LDR intensity drops|Technical|
|HL02|The moisture sensor will be able to sense the soil condition that is soil is dry or wet|Technical|
|HL03|panel when light fall on the LDR, the motor rotates towards that LDR that is clockwise and when light fall other LDR it rotates in anticlockwise|Technical|



# Low Level Requirements

|ID|Description|Catogary|
|-----|--------|---------|
|LL01|The energy collected from solar panel is stored into the battery|Technical|
|LL02|utilized wherever it required like for moisture sensor, for automated lights, relay etc|Technical|
|LL03|When there is no sun light fall or light fall on LDR it becomes darker and the automated lights gets turn on|Technical|

# Objectives

	Efficient Use of Solar Energy by Solar Tracking System.

	Power system and backup from solar.

	Sensor based irrigation which is directed by controller.

	Automated lights work during darkness.

	To minimize water waste from automated irrigation systems, we have improved irrigation controllers, which senses the soil.

	The overall system uses the energy from the stored solar power energy and acts power backup.
